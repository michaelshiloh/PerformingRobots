### Assignments Due Tuesday September 3

##### Reading Assignments:

- [Adafruit Music Maker Shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-music-maker-shield-vs1053-mp3-wav-wave-ogg-vorbis-player?view=all)
- [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels) 


##### Writing Assignments:

- Read the [Fall 2024 Performing Robots Performance
  Ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALBWsvQLPxUe5rj69ZUUuQ77TZxwMeKTieyRj6-6uic/edit) shared Google document which has the ideas we came up with in
  class for our performance 
- Everyone must add at least one more idea. Put your name in parenthesis so we
  can see that you did it. You are free to add as many as you wish.
- In your Github repository create a folder called "performanceIdeas" and in
  that folder create a file called "firstDraft03Sept2024"
- Choose one of the ideas (either yours or someone else's) and write a short
  outline of a play based on this idea. Describe very briefly 7 characters
  that will perform in this play. Put all this in the file
  "firstDraft03Sept2024" 

##### Thinking Assignments:

Later in the semester each one of you will give two presentation. I want you
to do some preliminary research and think about your topics:

- An artist, art collective that is using robots in a performative way, or a
  specific robot that is being used in a performative way
- An academic or otherwise substantial book, research paper, lecture, etc.
  that explores the way robots are being used in performative ways

- A researcher or writer or group or book (non-fiction) discussing robot
  ethics. Fiction or movies might also be options but you have to make a
  strong case for the serious discussion taking place

Your presentations must be at least 12 minutes long up to a maximum of 20
minutes. Your presentation must show evidence of serious research, and not
just a summary of a website or wikipedia entry. If in doubt, ask me.

Your choice of topic will be due on September 10, and presentations will start
on September 17.  Topics are to be delivered by email to mshiloh@nyu.edu. I
will evaluate your topic and in some cases may send it back to you for further
development. If two people choose the same topic, the first email timestamp
will get the topic and the second must make an alternate choice.

If you wish, you may send me your topic earlier. 

You might be inspired by topics chosen by students in previous sessions, as
well as ideas from [this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/references.md) list
