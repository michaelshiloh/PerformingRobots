  - No necklaces or bracelets or other dangling jewelery
  - Expect to get dusty (sawdust, metal shavings)

Email Assignment:

- Join Discord
- Create a Github account, if you do not have one. Instructions are
  [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources)
- Create a repository called "performingrobots" in your Github account. 
- Send me email with:
    - A link to your github *repository* (not the account!!!!)
    - Discord screen name 

Reading Assignment:

- Review or learn the following:
    - What is an Arduino
    - How to use `setup()` and `loop()`
    - How to use the `digitalWrite()`, `digitalRead()`, `analogWrite()`, and
      `analogRead()` functions
    - How to use the internal pullup resistors
    - How to wire up a switch and an LED on a solderless breadboard
    - How to use the `if ... else` construct
    - How to use an L298 H-bridge to control the direction and speed of a
      motor

### Assignments Due Thursday September 11
1. Finish mounting the caster wheel and the two motors to your wooden
   platform. You can use the tools in the IM lab whenever it is staffed,
   either by Dustin or a lab assistant. 
	1. Be sure to clean up after yourselves.
	1. Obey safety protocols
	1. Wear closed toed shoes and safety glasses
	1. Dress properly: hair tied back, no loose jewelery or clothes, etc.
1. Since we will be doing a lot of fabrication in this class, I suggest that
   you always dress appropriately.
1. We need to start working on the play. Please bring to class **two**
   concepts for plays.

#### todays-assignment
### Assignments Due Tuesday September 16

#### Play
Create an outline of the play consisting of at least five scenes. for each
   scene, describe the characters and summarize the scene: 
1. Beginning scene (sort of an introduction)
1. Intermediate scene A
1. Intermediate scene B
1. Intermediate scene C
1. Final scene (wraps up any loose ends, closes the play)

#### Arduino
1. Refresh your memory of how to use **arrays** in Arduino. Use any resource you
   like, such as
   [this](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/data-types/array/)
   or
   [this](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/control-structures/Arrays/).
   If you find a different resource that you find particularly useful, please
   post it on our Discord channel.
1. Read [this](https://ece353.engr.wisc.edu/firmware-basics/interrupts/) very basic introduction to **interrupts**. 
1. Read [this](https://ryanboland.com/blog/reading-rc-receiver-values)
   description of using the **EnableInterrupt** library to read the signals
   from a Hobby RC radio receiver

#### Soldering
Read the first two of the following
guides on soldering, and watch the third video between 0:17 and 0:28 seconds.
Play the video over a few times and pay careful attention. 
- Note how the solder **sticks to both the pin and the round pad on the
  circuit board.**
- Note that **only just enough solder is used**, so as not to create
  an unwanted connection (a *short circuit*) between two pins.
