Stefania sent earlier this evening, or use other resources.
I want you to know the following:
    - How to use `setup()` and `loop()`
    - How to use the `digitalWrite()`, `digitalRead()`, `analogWrite()`, and
      `analogRead()` functions
    - How to wire up a switch and an LED on a solderless breadboard
    - How to use the `if ... else` construct

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 3

##### Reading Assignments:

- [Adafruit Music Maker Shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-music-maker-shield-vs1053-mp3-wav-wave-ogg-vorbis-player?view=all)
- [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels) 


##### Writing Assignments:

- Read the [Fall 2024 Performing Robots Performance
  Ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALBWsvQLPxUe5rj69ZUUuQ77TZxwMeKTieyRj6-6uic/edit) shared Google document which has the ideas we came up with in
  class for our performance 
- Everyone must add at least one more idea. Put your name in parenthesis so we
  can see that you did it. You are free to add as many as you wish.
- In your Github repository create a folder called "performanceIdeas" and in
  that folder create a file called "firstDraft03Sept2024"
- Choose one of the ideas (either yours or someone else's) and write a short
  outline of a play based on this idea. Describe very briefly 7 characters
  that will perform in this play. Put all this in the file
  "firstDraft03Sept2024" 

##### Thinking Assignments:

Later in the semester each one of you will give two presentation. I want you
to do some preliminary research and think about your topics:

- An artist, art collective that is using robots in a performative way, or a
  specific robot that is being used in a performative way
- An academic or otherwise substantial book, research paper, lecture, etc.
  that explores the way robots are being used in performative ways

- A researcher or writer or group or book (non-fiction) discussing robot
  ethics. Fiction or movies might also be options but you have to make a
  strong case for the serious discussion taking place

Your presentations must be at least 12 minutes long up to a maximum of 20
minutes. Your presentation must show evidence of serious research, and not
just a summary of a website or wikipedia entry. If in doubt, ask me.

Your choice of topic will be due on September 10, and presentations will start
on September 17.  Topics are to be delivered by email to mshiloh@nyu.edu. I
will evaluate your topic and in some cases may send it back to you for further
development. If two people choose the same topic, the first email timestamp
will get the topic and the second must make an alternate choice.

If you wish, you may send me your topic earlier. 

You might be inspired by topics chosen by students in previous sessions, as
well as ideas from [this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/references.md) list

### Assignments Due Thursday September 5

Using scrap circuit boards 
and scrap wire
from the blue bins on top of the soldering area, 
practice soldering. 

* Practice until you can solder wires on adjacent holes without
  making a short circuit
* Practice with header pins (or sockets) from the consumables area
    * Use lengths of about 5 pins
    * Make sure the header pins are straight and sitting flush on the board

Bring examples of your best work to class so that we can learn from each other

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 10
Thank you all for your great work today! You made great progress. Here is what
I want you to finish for next week:

1. If you have not done so, finish getting the Music Maker Shield to play your
   sound file. As we have discovered we had a bad Arduino, two bad speakers,
   and a bad microSD card. If you can't get yours to work reach out on the
   class Discord channel and describe your problem, and either I or someone
   else will help.
2. Get your NeoPixel strip working
	1. Very carefully solder **stranded** wires to the 
    `DIN`, `5V`, and `GND` pins. 
    You only need a wire on one of the 
    `5V` and `GND` pins.
	1. At the end of the stranded wire, solder on a short piece of **solid**
    core wire so that you can poke the wire into your Arduino sockets
	1. Cover the exposed junction of the stranded wire and the solid core
    wire with heat shrink tubing.
	1. Open your Arduino IDE and Install the `Adafruit_NeoPixel` library 
	1. Test your NeoPixel by using the simple built-in example:
    `File->Examples->Adafruit NeoPixel->Simple`
	1. Upload to Discord a video of your NeoPixel blinking!
	1. Problems? Discord! Class channel!

### Assignments Due Thursday September 12

There are two assignments for Thursday: the one I assigned on Saturday,
and the new one from class on Tuesday. Both are due on Thursday:

##### Voting Assignment:

Read the play outlines that each of your classmates wrote. 
You can find links to all the repositories 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/studentRepos.md)

Vote for your top 3 using
[this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf52IvdQ2OGLJ6Ww-iewBF7EI9MZxUSMB0hr8HYTg8cpUkTXg/viewform)
form

##### Email Assignment:

Starting on September 17,
each one of you will give two presentation. You may
choose two of the following three topics:

- An artist or art collective that is using robots in a performative way, or a
  specific robot that is being used in a performative way.
- An academic or otherwise substantial book, research paper, lecture, etc.
  that explores the way robots are being used in performative ways.
- A researcher or writer or group or book (non-fiction) discussing robot
  ethics. Fiction or movies might also be options but you have to make a
  strong case for the serious discussion taking place,
  and you have to scholarly material to support your claims.

Your presentations must be at least 12 minutes long up to a maximum of 20
minutes. Your presentation must show evidence of serious research, and not
just a summary of a website or wikipedia entry. If in doubt, ask me.

Topics are to be **delivered by email** to mshiloh@nyu.edu. 
I will evaluate your topic and 
in some cases may send it back to you for further development. 
If two people choose the same topic, 
the first email timestamp
will get the topic and the second must make an alternate choice.

You might be inspired by topics chosen by students in previous sessions, as
well as ideas from [this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/references.md) list.

Presentations will start on September 17. You may schedule your 
presentations on
[this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8S0qX6co3bIBSuFY7zDSmBrV4rCpc_IT61iG6xhgfM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) spreadsheet. 

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 17

There are three assignments due:

(I) Play Outline

1. Collaborate with entire class (use whatever communication method you wish)
    to create a rough outline for the play collaboratively. 
    Pay particular attention
    to the character that you have chosen to make sure you are happy with your
    character's role. Add as much detail as you can. The shared document is
    [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14n8aM1Zh9eJmkvJriH-87WQnF9FcQNhilrOcNERecpM/edit).
1. Choose a partner and a character that you and your partner would like to
   work on
1. Start thinking about how your robot will express the personality of your
    character.

(II) Journal

1. Each of you will keep a journal of your progress. Each entry in the journal
   will be dated.
1. In your Github repository create a file called "journal.md". 
1. Start designing your robot. What special 
  features does it need? How will you construct it? Make a quick sketch and
  include it in your journal, along with a description. 
1. Each entry in the journal must be preceded by the date
    like this: <pre>### 17 September 2024</pre>. The hash marks will create
    a heading link. For an example, look in this file at the heading
    <pre>#### todays-assignment</pre>.
1. Use proper markdown to format your journal properly.
1. Since you are working in teams, only one of you needs to create
    a given journal entry, but you both need to have a journal,
    and when the entry is in your partner's journal, you need to create a link
    in yours. For an example, see the top two lines of this file, where
    I have created links to the next homework assignment and today's lecture.

(III) Presentations

1. Presentations start on Tuesday September 17 according to the
[schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8S0qX6co3bIBSuFY7zDSmBrV4rCpc_IT61iG6xhgfM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
1. As mentioned above, presentations must be at least 12 minutes long up to a
   maximum of 20 minutes. Your presentation must show evidence of serious
   research, and not just a summary of a website or wikipedia entry. If in
   doubt, ask me. I encourage you to use the library and the librarians for
   help in research. Following your presentation you must initiate a
   discussion by providing at least three thought-provoking questions.

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 24

(1)
Add details to the outline of the 
play in
[this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14n8aM1Zh9eJmkvJriH-87WQnF9FcQNhilrOcNERecpM/edit)
shared document. 
Map out each scene, identify which characters are involved,
and describe the conversations.
We don't need the full script at this point, but 
the entire story should be mapped out. 

I suggest that for now you do not
allow audience input and alternative plots. You can add that later if you have
time.

A good way to start might be with your own character and whatever
other characters you want to interact with. As each of you do this,
the entire play will slowly start to take shape.

Everyone should participate, and you should work on this collaboratively.
Each of you should respect what others 
have already written, but I encourage you to 
suggest changes that you feel will make the play better.

(2)
In your journal, describe what you did in class on Thursday, and add a few
pictures of your process

### Assignments Due Thursday September 26

I'm pleased to see that the play outline is taking shape. For Thursday, I'd
like you to add the 2-3 scenes where the characters split up and look for
clues.

1. Since there are 7 characters in the play (including detective and butler),
   you can break up into groups of 2, 2, and 3 characters.
1. Decide which other character(s) you would like to work with for this scene.
   For example, Dr. Orchid might be with Wadsworth. Don't take too long
   thinking about this, just reach out and start working out what you'll do in
   this scene
1. With the other team(s), outline what you will do in this scene.  This might
   be an opportunity to ask each other questions, revealing your prior
   relationship with Mr. Boddy and hints as to what your motives may have
   been. You might decide you like the other character, or you may start
   arguing with each other. You can start adding some dialogue to give us an
   idea of how this will go.
1. Add your scene, outline, and dialogue to the collaborative outline

### Assignments Due Tuesday October 1

(1)
##### Play homework

The play seems to be coming along well but we need a lot more detailed
dialogue. Some of you have not contributed your small group interaction
(Peacock and Orchid I think). Please do so by Tuesday.

The rest of you keep adding details, refining the story, and improving the
dialogue. 

* There are several scenes in which characters pick up something or give
  something. It is very difficult to build robots that can do this. Think of
  another way to move the plot forward. For instance, when Mr. Green finds
  something, that might be in his hand all along, but only now is attention
  drawn to it. Maybe this hand isn't raised until now. Or maybe it lights up
  to draw attention to it.

* Some scenes refer to a desk or unlocking a door. None of this exists unless
  we make it. We could borrow a table and bring it on stage between
  scenes. We will have to carefully plan who moves it.

* Scene 1 needs to be written. The first four items in "(Potential) Play
  outline" seem to be a summary of Scene 1 so that a good starting point, so
  use that and write the script

* The final scene needs to be written. The last item (7 FINAL SCENE: seems to
  be  a good start, so use that and write the script. 

(2)
##### Journal homework

In your journal, describe what you did in class on Thursday, and add a few
pictures of your process

### Assignments Due Thursday October 3
Inspired by the presentations on Tuesday October 1,
write down at least one question
that you have from each presentation today. Write the questions in your journal
with today's date.

### Assignments Due Tuesday October 22
(I)

As promised in class, I have created a form for each of you to provide
the who, how, and why of the murder.

(II)

Fall break ends on Sunday October 20. That gives you Monday and part of
Tuesday to complete your robot base. I want to see everyone's 
**robot base complete**
when class starts on Tuesday at 2:10pm:

- Arduino in its metal bracket mounted to the wooden base
- L298 H-Bridge in its plastic bracket mounted to the wooden base
- Battery attached with zip ties to the wooden base
- Motors wired to the L298 H-Bridge
- L298 H-Bridge connected to the Arduino with the L298 Breakout Board
  and the  Hobby RC and Motor Controller Shield. I have added detailed
  [instructions](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#hobby-rc-and-motor-controller-shield) 
  including videos of this to the lecture notes.

As I mentioned, I am not travelling and am available to help.

### Assignments Due Thursday October 24

Add an entry in your journal with the heading
<pre>
### 24 october 20204
</pre>

Refine the design of your robot. 
Include a sketch of the full
robot indicating placement and type of motors, and where the mechanisms are. 
Think about what it needs to do and sketch
out how each mechanism might be constructed. 
Add details of each mechanism as a separate sketch.

### Assignments Due Tuesday October 29

##### (I)

Your robot base was due on Tuesday October 22. Many of  you 
have failed to do this. You must do this by Tuesday October 29. 

##### (II)

Choose one feature of your robot and build it. 
This could be the peacock tail,
the skeleton and arms, 
the head with eyebrows or hair that is controlled by a servo motor. 
You will need supplies like wood, motors, brackets, and hardware. 
Ask for these things on Discord.

Be ready to demonstrate this on Tuesday.

##### (III)
Your journal.md should be in the top level of your repository.
If it is not, move it there.

##### todays-assignment
### Assignments Due Thursday October 31

**If your base is not complete, you must finish it!**

1. Build either the skeleton or the robot body. 
1. Take from my plastic boxes behind the white board
1.1. Arduino Mega 
1.1. Arduino mounting box (like the one you used for the Arduino on the base) 
1. Mount the Arduino Mega in the box using the little plastic standoffs
