### Assignments Due Thursday September 11
1. Finish mounting the caster wheel and the two motors to your wooden
   platform. You can use the tools in the IM lab whenever it is staffed,
   either by Dustin or a lab assistant. 
	1. Be sure to clean up after yourselves.
	1. Obey safety protocols
	1. Wear closed toed shoes and safety glasses
	1. Dress properly: hair tied back, no loose jewelery or clothes, etc.
1. Since we will be doing a lot of fabrication in this class, I suggest that
   you always dress appropriately.
1. We need to start working on the play. Please bring to class **two**
   concepts for plays.

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 16

#### Play
Create an outline of the play consisting of at least five scenes. For each
   scene, list the characters involved and summarize the scene. Typically, all
   characters will be in the first and last scene: 
1. Beginning scene (sort of an introduction)
1. Intermediate scene A
1. Intermediate scene B
1. Intermediate scene C
1. Final scene (wraps up any loose ends, closes the play)

#### Arduino
1. Refresh your memory of how to use **arrays** in Arduino. Use any resource you
   like, such as
   [this](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/variables/data-types/array/)
   or
   [this](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/control-structures/Arrays/).
   If you find a different resource that you find particularly useful, please
   post it on our Discord channel.
1. Read [this](https://ece353.engr.wisc.edu/firmware-basics/interrupts/) very basic introduction to **interrupts**. 
1. Read [this](https://ryanboland.com/blog/reading-rc-receiver-values)
   description of using the **EnableInterrupt** library to read the signals
   from a Hobby RC radio receiver

#### Soldering
Read the first two of the following
guides on soldering, and watch the third video between 0:17 and 0:28 seconds.
Play the video over a few times and pay careful attention. 
- Note how the solder **sticks to both the pin and the round pad on the
  circuit board.**
- Note that **only just enough solder is used**, so as not to create
  an unwanted connection (a *short circuit*) between two pins.

Soldering Resources [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#soldering)

### Assignments Due Thursday September 18
1. Create an outline of the play 
1. Before class, one person from each team should go to the Equipment Center
   (near the Project Space) and check out the RadioLink RC4GS kit with the RC transmitter,
   receiver, batteries, and battery charger. 
1. Dress appropriately for working in the IM fabrication area

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 23

- Finish attaching the Arduino, L298 H-bridge, and battery to your robot base
- Drill holes in based to allow the wires from the motors to come to the top
- Extend the motor wires by soldering. If your soldering looks excellent, and
  if you know how to use heat shrink tubing, you may insulate your solder joint
  with heat shrink tubing. If you are unsure, leave your wires exposed until I
  can inspect them (Monday or in class).
- Charge all six of your AA batteries for the RadioLink RC4GS transmitter

### Assignments Due Thursday September 25
#### Soldering

Make some progress on the soldering work we discussed today. I have
added
more [detailed
notes](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#soldering-wires-between-l298-breakout-board-and-hobby-rc-and-motor-controller-shield) in the lecture notes. I will try to add pictures too.
Watch the videos first.

### Assignments Due Tuesday September 30

#### Robot base
Finish your robot base. That includes:
- All wiring
- Pair your radio transmitter and receiver
- Combine the code for controlling the motors with the code for reading the
  radio signals. At the very least:
  - Robot can move forwards and backwards by remote control at a fixed speed
- Bonus:
    - Add the ability to steer your robot i.e. to make turns
    - Add the ability to vary the speed

#### Research Presentations
- Presentations will happen on Tuesdays
- We will have three presentations per day
- Select a date for your presentation on the 
  [same](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H67fPcgNpJAw_h9IF7Uh4UINfpykP3S3smrm_njblvk/edit?usp=sharing) list

#### Research topics
In groups of two, choose two research topics on which you will give a
presentation: 1) a team or individual creator (artist, designer, engineer) who
creates robotic performers or performances and 2) a machine or device that is
a robotic performer. You can define the word "robot" quite broadly, but it
must have a physical presence and physically interact with the world outside
of a computer screen.
- Do not work with your robot partner
- Choose a different group of two for each presentation
- In-depth, serious research, analysis and critique are required. Your
  presentation must not simply be a collection of facts. Use the library and
  the writing center. I will provide more detailed guidelines.
- You may find some inspiration in these
  [references](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/references.md)
  or in these
  [resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses). 
- Enter the names of your chose topics in
  [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H67fPcgNpJAw_h9IF7Uh4UINfpykP3S3smrm_njblvk/edit?usp=sharing)
  list. If a topic is already chosen, you must choose another. After your
  presentation, add a link.
- Presentation can be of any form. 


### Assignments Due Thursday October 2

1. Build the basic frame of your robot body. It must be at least 1.5 meters
   tall. It does not need to be detailed or have any limbs or additional
   features. Contact me via Discord if you need any additional materials or
   have questions.
1. From now on you will document your work. Create a file in your Github
   repository called `journal.md`. Create a dated entry and add some pictures
   of you creating your robot body. 

### Assignments Due Tuesday October 7
1. The frame of the torso of your robot should be substantially complete. What
   this means exactly will vary for each one of you. I want to see the basic
   shape of your robot. Heads, limbs, or other appendages are not necessary.
   Clothing or other visual treatment is not necessary.
1. On Tuesday I would like to start attaching servo motors to your robots.
   Therefore, I would like each robot to have one potential site for a servo
   motor constructed and ready for a motor. This could be for an arm or other
   appendage, or for hair or a cigar or whatever. The important thing is that
   there is some wood ready to which to attach the servo motor bracket. 
1. As always, document your work in your journal.md

#### Notes
- As requested, I have changed the presentation schedule so that we will start
  on October 21 and end on November 18. There are three slots open, which
  means that three groups have not added themselves to the schedule. Please
  complete this.
- Three groups (Mariam and Jiho, Ghadir and Aysha, Torico and Jiho) have not
  yet chosen a topic. This was due on September 30 so you are late. Please
  complete this.
- I am available over the weekend if you need parts or assistance with your
  robot, but only if you message me early enough. 

### Assignments Due Thursday October 9
1. Each team should have one servo motor attached to the body of their robot.

### Research presentations start on Tuesday October 21
#### Guidelines for Research Presentations
- Apply critical media concepts and context by analyzing and critiquing the work
  in cultural, social, historical, ethical, and aesthetic contexts.
- Include **original** (this means that you wrote it) analysis and opinion
- In the case of a team or individual creator (artist, designer, engineer,
  etc.), carefully research their entire body of work, and describe their 
  ethos, thinking, motives, and artistic positions.
- In the case of a machine, device, or project that is a robotic performer (where the
  word "robot" can be defined quite broadly)
    - Carefully research the goals,
  thinking, ethos, and artistic positions of the creator(s) and describe it
  in the context of this particular device.  
    - Describe the critical and
  conceptual framing of the project.
    - Provide a formalized opinion (your own) about this work
    - Describe how this work was made
    - Describe  what technology was used
    - Describe how the technology informs the concept of the work
- Your presentation must:
    - Be around 15 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions
    - Be linked in
      [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H67fPcgNpJAw_h9IF7Uh4UINfpykP3S3smrm_njblvk/edit?usp=sharing)
      document, allowing everyone access
    -  Include everyone's names
    -  Have a title
    -  Contain images, video or sound recording, or links to same, as
       necessary and **relevant**
    -  Be designed professionally:
        - Communicates your idea effectively
        - Considers aesthetics
        - Doesn't repeat itself, or include pointless sentences that don't
          convey any information
        - Shows evidence of attention to detail (spelling, grammar,
          consistency, formatting, etc.)
    -  Concludes with key prompts for conversation. What questions do you have
       having done this research? 
- Review the
  [Guidelines for a writing a Reading
  Response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xj8PSNpghJoQFhTP8wPr7B1zJvqIOD_KqPtYluU3LXs/edit?usp=sharing)
  and the [How to Read for
  Writers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FC6QJkknB4KRuUrrVPrvB2u_X4F-QYIK0SG9ieIs3s/edit?usp=sharing)
  for more suggestions. Since these are aimed at readings responses, consider
  how to apply this to your presentation.

### Assignments Due Tuesday November 4
1. Use the nRF radio system to control the Music Maker Shield for at least two
   different sound clips

### Assignments Due Tuesday November 11
Our walk through on Thursday was pretty sad. 
I think that only one of you was able to play any sound clip (who was that?)
and I don't remember that any of you were able to control any of your features
using the nRF radio system. If I am wrong please correct me. So you all have a
lot of catching up to do.

Let me also remind you that homework is due at the **beginning** of class, not
at the end. 

1. Catch up with the homework that was due last Thursday November 6 
   and Tuesday November 4 (see above) 
1. Charge all of your batteries. I have installed two outlet strips behind the
   white board for charging robot batteries:
    1. Six AA batteries in the hobby RC transmitter
    1. One big Talentcell battery on your robot base 
    1. Two Anker batteries: One for the Arduino Uno on the base and another for
the Arduino Mega controlling the robot features. Ask me if you do not have them.
1. Put your names on anything that is not attached to the robot:
	1. Six AA batteries in the hobby RC transmitter
	1. Two Anker batteries
	1. Hobby RC transmitter
	1. nRF radio system transmitter
	1. Talentcell battery charger (it's the one that says 12.6V)
	1. Amplifier
1. Make sure that your robot can still drive! Last Thursday only one robot was
   able to drive (who was that?)
1. Make progress implementing necessary features (added Sunday)

#### todays-assignment
### Assignments Due Tuesday November 25
We are now 15 days away from our performance. In the 9 years that I've taught
this class, we have never been so far behind. What went wrong? Here is what I
want from you on Tuesday:

Last Thursday we made a list of the
[status](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#robot-status)
of each robot. 
* I want each of you to make a schedule showing how you 
will have each of these problems solved
by **Friday November 28** which is already
ridiculously late
* Put this schedule in your journal so that I can inspect it
