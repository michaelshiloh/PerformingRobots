### September 14

Administration

- Welcome to week 2!
- Record lesson
- Questions about the homework

Test Arduino 
- Install [CH340
	driver](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers)
- IDE
- blink

What else can we do?
- Serial
- IO foursome

Review
- Varibles
	- int, float
	- Difference between 
		- Declaration, which creates, or allocates, the variable
		- Assignment, which gives it a value
- Varible scope
	- Local
		- Allocation and freeing
	- Global
		- Allocated and never freed
- Functions

Reminder:
- Good variable and function names
- Indentation (demonstrate CTRL-T)

In-class exercise:
- Write a function that blinks an LED 5 times
	- Call it from setup
	- Call it from loop
	- How would you make it happen only once from loop?
		- State variable

Functions with arguments
- One argument
- Multiple arguments
- Return value!

Here are the examples we developed in class. First 
a function that takes two arguments and returns nothing:

````
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  sayHello(9.7, 107); // intentionally passed the wrong parameter to show what happens
}

// A function that takes two arguments and returns nothing
void sayHello(int someInt, float someFloat) {
  Serial.print(someInt);
  Serial.print("  ");
  Serial.print(someFloat);
  Serial.println(" hello");
}
````

And now a function that takes one argument and returns something:

````
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

boolean firstTime = true; // state variable remembers whether it's the first time or not

void loop() {
  if (firstTime == true) {
    float theAnswer = blinkTimes(5);
    firstTime = false;
    Serial.println(theAnswer);
  }
}

// A function that takes one argument and returns a float
float blinkTimes(int count) {
  for (int i = count; i > 0; i -= 1) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
  return (count / 3.0);
}
````

MP3 Trigger

- Sparkfun
	[documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-mp3-trigger-hookup-guide/all)
- Insert uSD card gently
	- **Caution**: Do not pull on the uSD card! It must be pressed to be released!
- Library: SparkFun MP3 Trigger
- Use USB-C cable to connect drigger
	- It should show up as a thumb drive
	- Copy an MP3 file to the card. You can use [this](media/T001.mp3) or
		[this](media/T002.mp3)
- Example: Example1-PlaySong
- What else can the library do?
	- Look at other examples
	- [Functions](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_MP3_Trigger_Arduino_Library/blob/master/src/SparkFun_Qwiic_MP3_Trigger_Arduino_Library.h)
- Start thinking about what kind of sounds your robot will make. Will it
	speak? What kind of a voice will it use? Will it make non-speech sounds?
	Start collecting sounds that might be useful. You can record your own or
	find them on the internet (be sure to document where you got them) e.g.
	[here](https://archive.org/details/HB01SFX)

Motor Driver

- Sparkfun
	[documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hookup-guide-for-the-qwiic-motor-driver)
- Connect motors (polarity doesn't matter)
- Connect battery connector 
	- **Caution** polarity is critical!!
	- **Caution** do not plug in the battery until you have checked 3 times
	that the polarity is right!!
	- **Caution** Do not touch the battery to the connector backwards!!
- Library: Serial Controlled Motor Driver
- Example: Copy example from
	[here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hookup-guide-for-the-qwiic-motor-driver#experiment-1-testing-the-motors)
	(scroll down a little bit)

Here is the motor dance code:

````
void loop()
{
  // do a little dance and then stop
  //    stop both motors for 5 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //Stop motor
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //Stop motor
  delay (5000);

  // go forward for 10 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 200);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 180);
  delay(10000);

  // turn right just a little
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 50);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 25);
  delay(500);


  // if you don't want it to stop, remove this:
  while (1)

#### Discussion about final

- Make non-blocking classes to
	- Display animations on display
	- Movement (wheels)
- Discussion:
	- What shall we do for final performance?
		- Constrained or entirely unrestricted?
			- unrestricted with optional constraints for those who prefer

what did you learn about building it this time that you would do
differently next time ?


#### Monday November 9

#### Administration

- Record

#### My homework
- usingButtonWithoutInit or Example1_PrintButtonStatus
- OLEDUsesLotsOfMemory

#### Arduino memory
- What is memory?
	- It's all 1s and 0s
		- So it's binary
		- But what is it really?
- How is memory organized
	- Each individual 0 or 1 is a single Binary DIgit, called a *bit* 
	- Bits are organized in groups of 8 called a *byte*
	- Memory is organzied as an array of bytes, each with a unique address
	- 1024 bytes are called a kilobyte
- Arduino memory
	- Different types of memory
		- Flash (32K bytes) - retained without power, can't be modified by program
		- SRAM (2K bytes) - lost without power loss, can be modified by program
		- EEPROM (1K bytes) - retained without power, can be modified by program
	- Why so many? And how are they used?
		- Flash: Where your uploaded program goes
		- SRAM: Where variables go
		- EEPROM: Rarely used (it's quite cumbersome)
	- How do I know how much is being used?
		- Output of compilation of OLEDUsesLotsOfMemory:  
		````Sketch uses 13806 bytes (42%) of program storage space. 
		Maximum is 32256 bytes.
		Global variables use 999 bytes (48%) of dynamic memory, 
		leaving 1049 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
		````
	- That looks like plenty, what was the problem with OLEDUsesLotsOfMemory?
		- From Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp:

		````
		bool Adafruit_SSD1306::begin(uint8_t vcs, uint8_t addr, bool reset, bool periphBegin) {
		if ((!buffer) && !(buffer = (uint8_t *)malloc(WIDTH * ((HEIGHT + 7) / 8))))
		return false;
		````

		- Now since WIDTH = 128, HEIGHT = 64, `malloc()` asks for 1136 bytes!
		- But we only had 1039 bytes available,
			so the ````malloc()```` fails 
			which causes ````begin()```` to fail 
			which is why we get the message ````SSD1306 allocation failed````
	- So what can we do?
		- Remember that we have much more program memory (Flash) than
		variable memory (SRAM). IN fact, we only used
		13806 out of 32256 bytes. Now since strings aren't going to change, they
		we can put them in program memory. The easiest way to do that is with the
		`F()` macro which uses the PROGMEM variable modifier
			- `Serial.println("this message consumes valuable SRAM");`
			- `Serial.println(F("this message is in Flash memory"));`
			- [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/utilities/progmem/)
			for the `PROGMEM` variable modifier which is used by the `F()` macro 
- Excellent
	[reference](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/memories-of-an-arduino.pdf) about Arduino memory in general and in much more detail

#### New material
- [wiggleStateMachineClass](src/wiggleStateMachineClass/wiggleStateMachineClass.ino) the class implements the state machine internally
- [OLEDAnimationBruteForce](src/OLEDAnimationBruteForce/OLEDAnimationBruteForce.ino) large OLED animation, brute force method
- [Large OLED animation, using a
	class](src/OLEDAnimationClass/OLEDAnimationClass.ino)

#### Performance Constraint
The storyline of your final performance has to come from a song 
or a poem and has to incorporate some (or all) of the lyrics at some point, 
but spoken, not sung. Your song or poem could be from any culture and any
source: modern, classical, popular, epic, etc. 
Among your final documentation you will 
explain the original source and how you adapted it to your performance.
