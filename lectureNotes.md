- What is this class about?
- [weekly schedule](weeklySchedule.md)
- [Syllabus](syllabus.md)
- Summary:
  - Be on time
  - Bring a notebook to class to take notes
  - Be present and participate in class by thinking, discussing, and making
  - Be experimental: try things you don't know
  - No electronic distractions
  - Be proactive: Communicate with me regarding difficulties, problems, illness, etc. Don't wait until the last minute when I can't help you
  -  Allow lots of time for homework as physical construction
  and debugging circuits and programs can be very time consuming, and your
  ability to estimate how long something should take is very likely wrong
  unless you've done something very much like this before

- Who am I?
- Who are you?
	- Have you used Arduino before?
    - What experience do you have with construction?
    - What experience do you have with hand and power tools?
