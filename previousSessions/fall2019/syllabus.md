### Course Description

Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline
relegated to the world of science-fiction. 
However, from military organizations and manufacturing companies to
mobile devices and maid services, the 21st century has
witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in both the private and
public sector.  

Assuming robotic technology continues to proliferate, what will it mean for us
to live amongst robots? What will these robots look like and how will they
behave? How can we meaningfully effect their development and impact? If the
history of predicting the future has taught us anything, it's that predictions
are often inaccurate. We shouldn't expect that our future with robots will
look or act very much like most science-fiction depictions. However, as new
technologies are developed, it tends to be artists who are the first to apply
these technologies in surprising, unanticipated, and often enlightening
fashions.

Thus, in this course, students will explore the significance of robots through
the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for
theatrical performance. We will define robots broadly and consider a wide
range of machines, both autonomous and remote-controlled, for the purpose of
creative expression and performance. Fundamental questions we will attempt to
address include:

- Why make robotic performances?
- Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic performances be compelling?
- How can we create robots that convey meaning and emotion?
- What can robotic performers do that human performers can't? And is that
	important for a performance?

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical
performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics,
programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the
course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple robotic
projects culminating with their own performative robot. The course will
finish with a public performance by the robots.


### Learning Outcomes: 
When the course is finished, students will:
* Develop a conceptual model for the role and significance of robots in
daily life 
* Develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary
use of robots in the performing arts
* Establish a basic understanding of electronics, programming,
mechatronics, and simple robotics
* Gain the ability to identify, compare, and contrast  examples
of robotic interactivity, autonomy, and remote control
* Gain the ability to conceptualize, design, construct,
program, and debug a performing robot
* Become empowered to produce a Minimum Viable Project
(MVP) and adapt product dependencies (e.g. scripts) to
changing abilities

### Course Assignments
This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions, technical
training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics, designing,
fabricating, and programming a performing robot, and putting on a final
performance.

#### Reading Responses 
Each student is expected to post a short response to one of the readings of
their choosing the day before the lecture. The response should be about 300
words and should be posted on a public website (e.g. Tumblr, Blogger,
Wordpress, Github, the class website, or your own website). 


#### Homework exercises
Occasional homework exercises will be used to deepen understanding and
familiarity with technical material such as electronics and programming. All
material will be provided in the required course kit.

#### Projects
Class projects will consist of an introductory project, a midterm project, and
a final project project

** Introductory project (Motorized cardboard automata) due September 5 ** (15 points)  
** Midterm project (Cardboard Performing Robot) due October 24 ** (15 points)  
** Final project due December 10 ** (35 points)  


### Grading
**10%** Attendance  
**15%** Participation  
**10%** Journal  
**30%** Projects 1 and 2    
**35%** Final Project    

### Rubric

**Introductory project**
- Two simple machines 30%
- Solid construction 30%
- Runs for 30 seconds 40%
- Above & beyond 10%
- 15% less for each day late

**Midterm and Final projects**
- Functionality: 35%
The robot must function as you have described 
- Construction: 30%
Your robot must be robust and well constructed. 
For example, you must be able to move it
around or bump into it without it falling apart. It must not be delicate.
Any movement must have sufficient power to do so reliably.
- Creative appearance 15%
Appearance should evidence experimentation and creativity, but final result is
not so important, by which I mean I don't really care how it looks as long as
you've experimented
- Intentional behavior: 20%
This is a course in performing robots, 
and so your robot, as an actor, must be able to act in 
an intentional, repeatable manner. By this I mean that 
if the performance calls for a certain sequence of events, 
your robot must be able to perform that sequence reliably.

#### Attendance

Attendance in all classes is mandatory. Be on time and ready to start work at the posted start time.

Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.

Arriving more than ten minutes late to class will count as an unexcused absence.

More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in your attendance grade per absence. After four unexcused absences, you will fail the class.

An absence is excused if justified by a note from a medical professional or a
professor.


#### Participation
Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, asking questions and
offering answers and in general participating in lessons and discussions
during class is an important part of your grade. Participation in class is
important to deepen your understanding and is helpful for me to get to know
you as an individual and keep track of your progress, and, it provides you and
your classmates the opportunity to share successes, failures, and insights
into the work you are doing.

Turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will
result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).

You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github repository,
your attempts, and your results whether working or not. You will share what
worked and what didn't.  Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what
you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great
way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.
Showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is
an opportunity to learn. 

Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume that you are not
prepared for the lesson.

**Grades for Participation**

A - Always prepared for class including: 
seated and settled, with notebook and assignment ready, at the
beginning of each lesson, ready to engage in class discussion. Has questions
or observations prepared, and ready to answer questions from instructor. 
If encountered difficulty
with assignment, can clearly describe the unexpected behavior and what paths
were taken to try to resolve them. Asks questions in class.
Almost always engages in discussion with instructor and other students. 
Frequently offers assistance to other students.  
B - Prepared at least 80% of the time in most of the ways indicated above.  
C - Prepared at least 60% of the time in most of the ways indicated above.  
D - Prepared less than 60% of the time

### Readings
Readings will include selections from books, essays, articles, and research
papers both in print and in online form. 

All required readings will be available electronically.

Supplemental texts will be available electronically or in the library.

#### Required Textbooks
Kit for Performing Robots (available in the bookstore)

#### Supplemental Textbooks
[Here](references.md#books)

#### Laptops
Bring your laptop to every class, but save it for class-specific work. During
presentations, lectures, and discussions please keep your laptop closed
(unless necessary for the discussion). The quality of the class depends in
large part on your engagement and active participation, so please respect your
fellow classmates and close your lid.

#### Mobile Phones
Texting and other uses are prohibited during class.
Please silence and disable all calls and notifications.
If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
let me know me ahead of time and quietly step out of class to take the call.

#### Communicate
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, sign up for
office hours, speak with me before class, after class or during breaks.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the material or your
progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you have to take the
first step of reaching out to me.

### Academic Integrity
As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

### Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming, electronics, and
mechanisms work both inside and outside of the classroom.  Examples will
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask questions, and engage in both
creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented
philosophy believing that programming, electronics, and mechatronics
development are best learned by doing. 

In a way, this class has three tracks:

1. Readings and discussion
1. Skills
1. Projects

### Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

### Homework Assignments
There will be homework assignments in each class. Homework may include
reading, watching videos, doing exercises, constructing circuits and
mechanisms, and completing projects. Students may collaborate with classmates
and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their
own individual work.  

Some class time will be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to
show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work,
other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so.
All of your work must be completed on time prior to class.

### Online Journal
Students must document all their work in a Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.
