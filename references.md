## Notes

1. A robotic performance differs from a robotic installation in that a
performance has a beginning and end, and a script

1. A performance is a series of events created to be witnessed

1.  When interact with a robot, we have a model of the robot, but the robot
has no model of us
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind

1.  "Robots don't need to feel, they just need to give the impression they do" - Louise Lepage

## Questions

1. What is "Automata" vs. "Autonomous beings"?

1. What is interactive?

1. What is a robot? Can a robot be remote controlled or must it be autonomous?
	 
1. What is performance?

1. Will we arrive at a place where the fridge worries when the toaster goes
missing?

1. What is it that gives personality? Does a robot need to be anthropomorphic?
