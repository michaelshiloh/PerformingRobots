## Oriza Hirata's Robot Theatre

Oriza Hirata is a playwright and director who produced some important and
moving plays employing both human and robotic actors. In addition to plays he
has written, Hirata has also created android versions of Kenji Miyazawa’s
Night on the Galactic Railroad (2013),Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis (2014),
the Hamburg State Opera’s Stilles Meer (Silent Sea, 2016), and Chekhov’s
Three Sisters (2012).

manipulation, seduction - programming the audience
using low tech to give the impression of high tech
(also did walking berlin and abu dhabi)




## Notes

1. A robotic performance differs from a robotic installation in that a
performance has a beginning and end, and a script

1. A performance is a series of events created to be witnessed

1.  When interact with a robot, we have a model of the robot, but the robot
has no model of us
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind

1.  "Robots don't need to feel, they just need to give the impression they do" - Louise Lepage

## Questions

1. What is "Automata" vs. "Autonomous beings"?

1. What is interactive?

1. What is a robot? Can a robot be remote controlled or must it be autonomous?
	 
1. What is performance?

1. will we arrive at a place where the fridge worries when the toaster goes
missing?

1. What is it that gives personality? Does a robot need to be anthropomorphic?
	 Contrast that with
