### Course Description

Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline
relegated to the world of science-fiction. 
However, from military organizations and manufacturing companies to
mobile devices and maid services, the 21st century has
witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in both the private and
public sector.  

Assuming robotic technology continues to proliferate, what will it mean for us
to live amongst robots? What will these robots look like and how will they
behave? How can we meaningfully effect their development and impact? If the
history of predicting the future has taught us anything, it's that predictions
are often inaccurate. We shouldn't expect that our future with robots will
look or act very much like most science-fiction depictions. However, as new
technologies are developed, it tends to be artists who are the first to apply
these technologies in surprising, unanticipated, and often enlightening
fashions.

Thus, in this course, students will explore the significance of robots through
the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for
theatrical performance. We will define robots broadly and consider a wide
range of machines, both autonomous and remote-controlled, for the purpose of
creative expression and performance. Fundamental questions we will attempt to
address include:

- Why make robotic performances?
- Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic performances be compelling?
- How can we create robots that convey meaning and emotion?
- What can robotic performers do that human performers can't? And is that
	important for a performance?

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical
performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics,
programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the
course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple robotic
projects culminating with their own performative robot. The course will
finish with a public performance by the robots.

You do not need to prove your brilliance, but do prove your intellectual
engagement and curiosity.

### Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming, electronics, and
mechanisms work both inside and outside of the classroom.  Examples will
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask questions, and engage in both
creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented
philosophy believing that programming, electronics, and mechatronics
development are best learned by doing. 

This class has three components:

1. Readings, presentations, and discussions
1. Skills
1. Projects

### Grading

- **10%** Attendance  
- **15%** Participation  
- **10%** Journal  
- **30%** Assignments  
- **35%** Final Project    

### Grading Rubric

**Assignments**

- 30% Technical Operation
- 30% Creativity
- 30% Reliability 
- 10% Above & beyond

**Midterm and Final projects**
- Functionality: 35%  
The robot must function as you have described 
- Construction: 30%  
Your robot must be robust and well constructed. 
For example, you must be able to move it
around or bump into it without it falling apart. It must not be delicate.
Any movement must have sufficient power to do so reliably.
- Creative appearance 15%  
Appearance should evidence experimentation and creativity, and
be able to effectively express itself in the personality 
of the character it represents in the performance
- Intentional behavior: 20%  
This is a course in performing robots, 
and so your robot, as an actor, must be able to act in 
an intentional, repeatable manner. By this I mean that 
if the performance calls for a certain sequence of events, 
your robot must be able to perform that sequence reliably.

Student-Led Discussion:

- 100% Engaged the class fully in critical discussion of the reading(s)

Documentation Posts:

- 100% Clear story told with pictures, text, code, video, sketches, etc.


### Course Assignments

This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions; technical
training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics; designing,
fabricating, and programming a performing robot; and putting on a final
performance.

This is a very hands-on class. Some lessons might be mostly instruction,
some will be a combination of instruction and hands-on activity that
demonstrates your mastery of the content. Towards the end of the semester
you will spend much time in class demonstrating your robot 
and engaging in constructive criticism of your classmates robots.

All of your work must be documented in your Github repository. Instructions
will be given in class.

### Project documentation:

You are expected to document your work on your Github repository.
The purpose of
this is twofold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate to
me that you are keeping up with the work in the class. I read the site to see
how you are doing. You are expected to document your progress each week in 
detail, along with any other requested responses e.g. to readings, class
discussions, or student presentations.
Secondly, it is a way to document your work for your own use and that
of others.

You must update your repository weekly with the work you have done for class.

Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don’t put it off until the end.
Photos, video, drawings, schematics, and notes are all valuable forms of
documentation. Explain the project at the beginning of your documentation, so
that people who come to your site from outside this class can understand your
work quickly.

Use pictures, drawings, and videos liberally to explain your work. 
Videos can be uploaded to Vimeo, Youtube, or another video
hosting site and links provided in your Github documentation.

Always cite the sources of any technical information such as code or
schematics, the places you learned techniques from,
and the inspirations of your ideas. Copying code or techniques without
attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers
can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were
were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your
project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or
participant does in response. When it’s interactive, mention and show what the
user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s
never seen the project can understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a
more informed reader (your instructor, or next year’s classmates). Include a
system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and
how they communicate.

The writing is expected to be well reasoned, grammatically correct, and
written as if it were a paper being turned in. You should link to any relevant
sources, and provide as much context as you can using images, video, audio, or
other forms of expression. I’ll set you all up with an account the first day
of class.

#### Student-Led Discussions:

Throughout the semester there will be readings assigned to students
to lead subsequent discussion regarding the readings (or videos).

#### Final Project

Details will be provided in class

#### Attendance

This is an intense course. 
You should be prepared to spend many hours working on your robot.
I expect your attendance, attention, and engagement throughout the semester. 
If you do not feel that you can remain fully engaged in this course,
consider dropping it.
Your attention is demonstrated by not using phones or laptops or other
distractions. Your engagement is demonstrated by taking notes, by asking
questions, and by participating in discussions.

Attendance in all classes is mandatory. 
Be on time and ready to start work at the start of class.
If you plan on not attending more than 2 sessions during the semester, 
consider taking the course at some other time.

Arriving more than ten minutes late to class counts as an unexcused absence.
More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in
your attendance grade per absence. **After four unexcused absences, you will
fail the class.**

I do recognize that some absences are unavoidable.
If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If
you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can. To receive an excused
absence, you must ask in advance, and receive permission from me.

Absences due to holiday or vacation travel are unexcused asbsences.


#### Participation

Engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input in the class
is part of your grade. Participating in class discussions is helpful
for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress,
but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates with the opportunity
to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.

You are expected to show your work in class. This includes working projects 
as well as failed assignments or things that didn’t work the way you expected.
We often learn more from what didn't work than what did, so don't feel ashamed
to share. Celebrate what you learned in the course of the failure.

If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material
completely. Asking questions about concepts you do not understand and showing
work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an
opportunity to learn.

#### Laptops:

Laptop use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if
we’re in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates
are presenting or we’re in the midst of a class discussion, please keep your
laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your
attention and active participation, so please respect that and close your lid.

#### Mobile Phones:

Do not use your phone in class unless it is part of the lesson.
If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
tell me ahead of time.

#### Supplemental Textbooks

[Here](references.md#books)

#### Communicate

If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, sign up for
office hours, or any time you see me.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the material or your
progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you have to take the
first step of reaching out to me.

#### Academic Integrity

As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

#### Online Journal

Students must document all their work in their Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.

#### How to succeed in this course
1. Arrive on time or a few minutes early
1. Attend every lesson unless you are sick
1. Silence all notifications on your laptop, phone, and watch
1. Keep your watch and phone in your bag. Do not take them out during class.
1. Bring a notebook to class and take notes during class
1. Ask questions and participate in discussions and critique
1. During in-class hands-on activities, work diligently. Once you have the
   basic thing working, experiment with modifications.
1. Start homework and projects early
1. Document your work as you go along, writing directly in your journal. Take
   photographs (it's ok to use your phone for this) and videos as appropriate.
   Draw sketches in your notebook, photograph them, and add to your journal.
1. Pay attention when things go wrong. Try to understand why. Ask questions,
   do research on the internet.
1. Aim to have your robot assignments done two days before they are due
1. Expect things to take much longer than you think. Be pleasantly surprised
   when they don't. 
   Feel free to tell me that I was wrong.
1. Expect unexpected problems and failures
1. Expect things to not work when you think they should
1. Reach out to me early and often. 
    I like it when students ask me questions.
    Don't be afraid of becoming a nuisance to me. 
    That is my responsibility, 
    and in all my years of teaching that has never happened.
1. Beware of the word "should", such as "this shouldn't take too long" or
   "this should work". Unless you've built many robots in the past, you have
   no basis for making this judgement and you are probably wrong.
