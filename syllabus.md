### Course Description

Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline
relegated to the world of science-fiction. 
However, from military organizations and manufacturing companies to
mobile devices and maid services, the 21st century has
witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in both the private and
public sector.  

Assuming robotic technology continues to proliferate, what will it mean for us
to live amongst robots? What will these robots look like and how will they
behave? How can we meaningfully effect their development and impact? If the
history of predicting the future has taught us anything, it's that predictions
are often inaccurate. We shouldn't expect that our future with robots will
look or act very much like most science-fiction depictions. However, as new
technologies are developed, it tends to be artists who are the first to apply
these technologies in surprising, unanticipated, and often enlightening
fashions.

Thus, in this course, students will explore the significance of robots through
the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for
theatrical performance. We will define robots broadly and consider a wide
range of machines, both autonomous and remote-controlled, for the purpose of
creative expression and performance. Fundamental questions we will attempt to
address include:

- Why make robotic performances?
- Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic performances be compelling?
- How can we create robots that convey meaning and emotion?
- What can robotic performers do that human performers can't? And is that
	important for a performance?

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical
performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics,
programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the
course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple robotic
projects culminating with their own performative robot. The course will
finish with a public performance by the robots.

You do not need to prove your brilliance, but do prove your intellectual
engagement and curiosity.

\* The Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) are described in [Appendix 1: Interactive Media Major Program Learning Outcomes.](#appendix-1-interactive-media-major-program-learning-outcomes-plos)

### Teaching Methodology

This is a production based course. Students will be learning primarily through
hands-on experience and iterative experimentation. Classes will move quickly
through each topic, first providing a theoretical foundation along with
technical instruction, moving as quickly as possible to where students
implement each topic themselves.

Individual classes may
consist of, but not be limited to, the following:
lecture, discussion, examples, group work, 
demonstrations, hands-on exercises
and
presentations. 

Outside of the class, students will engage in both individual
and group work. Group work will require coordinating with other 
members of the group to schedule group meetings.

Students are required to 
operate their robots during a performance
as part of the Interactive Media End of Semester Showcase.

All required course materials will be provided. Students may optionally
elect to purchase additional accessories for their robot, but this is not
required.

### Graded Activities

| Weekly assignment | 20 | Weekly | See [Schedule](#schedule)
| Midterm | 20 | Week 7 | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| Panel | 20 | na | 6, 7 |
| Final project | 30 | Week 14 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Total | 100 | | |

#### Due Dates

Work submitted up to five days late will receive a reduced grade. Work more
than 5 days late will be accepted at the discretion of the professor. If you
need an extension please contact the professor in advance.

#### Attendance

This is an intense course.  You should be prepared to spend many hours working
on your robot.  I expect your attendance, attention, and engagement throughout
the semester.  If you do not feel that you can remain fully engaged in this
course, consider dropping it.  Your attendance is demonstrated by showing up
for every class on time. Your attention is demonstrated by not using phones or
laptops or other distractions. Your engagement is demonstrated by taking
notes, by asking questions, and by participating in discussions.

- Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the preceding one so it is
  vital to be present and on time for every lesson.
- I recognize that some absences are unavoidable.  If you know you are
  going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an
  emergency, let me know as soon as you can. To receive an excused absence,
  you must ask in advance, and receive permission from me.
- If you plan on not attending more than two meetings during the semester,
  consider taking the course at some other time.

Rubric:

- Arriving late by more than 10 minutes will count as an unexcused absence.
- More than two unexcused absences will result in a final grade of F.
- More than four excused absences will result in a final grade of F.
- Absences due to holiday or vacation travel will not be excused.

#### Participation

- Engaging in class discussions and offering advice, input, feedback, etc
  during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is
  helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your
  progress. What is equally important is that it provides you and your
  classmates the opportunity to learn from each other through the sharing of
  failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
- Students must be present at the IM end of semester show.

Rubric:
- Level of participation on a scale of 0 to 3,
    then prorated according to the
  [Percentage of Final Grade](#Graded-Activities)

| Performance Indicator | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency of participation in class and in meetings | Frequently initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; regularly contributes to discussion or asks questions | Occasionally initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; occasionally raises questions in meetings | Rarely initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; rarely raises questions in meetings | Does not initiate contributions and will only respond to direct questions posed to student; does not raise questions in meetings |
| Quality of comments / questions | Comments always insightful and constructive; asks insightful questions that demonstrate student has actively listened to the presentation and engaged with the material | Comments mostly insightful; asks questions that demonstrate good engagement with the material presented during the presentation | Comments are sometimes constructive; comments too long or not always relevant to discussion; comments have already been stated | Comments are uninformative; heavy reliance on general sentiment (“I don’t like the idea”, “sounds great”) |
| Listening skills | Actively listens during meetings / presentations, including when other students speak; builds on comments of others; never uses laptop inappropriately | Mostly attentive when others present or pose questions; occasionally needs reminder from instructor to focus or comment; was reminded once not to use laptop during presentations | Often inattentive and needs reminder to focus in class; interrupts others or otherwise disrupts others who are speaking; had to be reminded 2-3 in the semester not to use laptop during presentations | Does not listen to others; speaks while others speak; detracts from discussion; had to be reminded more than 4 times in the semester not to use laptop during presentations |

#### Weekly assignment 

- Weekly assignments consist primarily, but not exclusively, of steps in the
  development and construction of your robots
- Unless you have built many robots in the past, you are unlikely to have a
  good sense of how long tasks should take. Weekly assignments help keep the
  robot construction on track, alert me to difficulties, and break up the
  project into manageable chunks.
- Each week you are expected to report on your progress in your Github
  repository journal. Each journal entry should include a description of the
  assignment and how you addressed it. Include pictures, videos, and code
  snippets, as appropriate. Include the sources of any information you found
  useful such as code, schematics, explanations, etc.  Copying code or
  techniques without attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the
  blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you
  learned and by which you were were inspired.  The writing is expected to be
  well reasoned, grammatically correct, and written as if it were a paper
  being turned in. 

Rubric:

  Each weekly assignment is worth up to 2 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Percentage of Final Grade](#Graded-Activities)

| Excellent (2 points) | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| All parts of the assignment have been completed reliably and robustly; journal documentation is complete and well written | Most parts of the assignment have been completed and are mostly reliable and robost; documentation is mostly present and well written | Most parts of the assignment have been not been completed or are unreliable or not robust; journal entry is incomplete or absent |

#### Midterm 

- Working in teams of two, complete your robot base so that it can move
  forwards and backwards and can turn left and right, and do all of this at
  different speeds. Select a personality for your robot base and express it
  using only its ability to move.
- Document this thoroughly in your Github repository in a file called
  `midtermProject.md`. As you are working in teams, it is sufficient for the
  documentation to be in the repository of one of you, but the other person
  must still create a file called `midtermProject.md` and in it provide a link
  to the documentation in the other team member's repository.

Rubric:

The midterm assignment receives a maximum of 5 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Percentage of Final Grade](#Graded-Activities)

| Criteria | Excellent (5 points) | Very Good (4 points) | Good (3 points) | Marginal (2 points | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

#### Panel presentations

Each student will research a cultural, social, historical, ethical, or
aesthetic topic in the field of robotics, and develop and defend a thesis with
proper supporting evidence. Students will give their presentations in panels
consisting of four students. Each panel works together to read and discuss
each others' presentations, and each panelist will lead the class in a short
discussion on the presentation of one of the other panelists

Rubric:

The panel presentations receive a maximum of 10 points,
    then prorated according to the

### Other Course Information

#### Supplemental Textbooks

[Here](references.md#books)

#### How to succeed in this course
1. Arrive on time or a few minutes early
1. Attend every lesson unless you are sick
1. Silence all notifications on your laptop, phone, and watch
1. Keep your watch and phone in your bag. Do not take them out during class.
1. Bring a notebook to class and take notes during class
1. Ask questions and participate in discussions and critique
1. During in-class hands-on activities, work diligently. Once you have the
   basic thing working, experiment with modifications.
1. Start homework and projects early
1. Document your work as you go along, writing directly in your journal. Take
   photographs (it's ok to use your phone for this) and videos as appropriate.
   Draw sketches in your notebook, photograph them, and add to your journal.
1. Pay attention when things go wrong. Try to understand why. Ask questions,
   do research on the internet.
1. Aim to have your robot assignments done two days before they are due
1. Expect things to take much longer than you think. Be pleasantly surprised
   when they don't. 
   Feel free to tell me that I was wrong.
1. Expect unexpected problems and failures
1. Expect things to not work when you think they should
1. Reach out to me early and often. 
    I like it when students ask me questions.
    Don't be afraid of becoming a nuisance to me. 
    That is my responsibility, 
    and in all my years of teaching that has never happened.
1. Beware of the word "should", such as "this shouldn't take too long" or
   "this should work". Unless you've built many robots in the past, you have
   no basis for making this judgement and you are probably wrong.
