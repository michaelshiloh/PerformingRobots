### Course Description

Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline
relegated to the world of science-fiction. 
However, from military organizations and manufacturing companies to
mobile devices and maid services, the 21st century has
witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in both the private and
public sector.  

Assuming robotic technology continues to proliferate, what will it mean for us
to live amongst robots? What will these robots look like and how will they
behave? How can we meaningfully effect their development and impact? If the
history of predicting the future has taught us anything, it's that predictions
are often inaccurate. We shouldn't expect that our future with robots will
look or act very much like most science-fiction depictions. However, as new
technologies are developed, it tends to be artists who are the first to apply
these technologies in surprising, unanticipated, and often enlightening
fashions.

Thus, in this course, students will explore the significance of robots through
the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for
theatrical performance. We will define robots broadly and consider a wide
range of machines, both autonomous and remote-controlled, for the purpose of
creative expression and performance. Fundamental questions we will attempt to
address include:

- Why make robotic performances?
- Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic performances be compelling?
- How can we create robots that convey meaning and emotion?
- What can robotic performers do that human performers can't? And is that
	important for a performance?

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical
performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics,
programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the
course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple robotic
projects culminating with their own performative robot. The course will
finish with a public performance by the robots.

You do not need to prove your brilliance, but do prove your intellectual
engagement and curiosity.

### Learning Outcomes: 
When the course is finished, students will:
* Develop a conceptual model for the role and significance of robots in
daily life 
* Develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary
use of robots in the performing arts
* Establish a basic understanding of electronics, programming,
mechatronics, and simple robotics
* Gain the ability to identify, compare, and contrast  examples
of robotic interactivity, autonomy, and remote control
* Gain the ability to conceptualize, design, construct,
program, and debug a performing robot
* Become empowered to produce a Minimum Viable Project
(MVP) and adapt product dependencies (e.g. scripts) to
changing abilities

### Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming, electronics, and
mechanisms work both inside and outside of the classroom.  Examples will
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask questions, and engage in both
creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented
philosophy believing that programming, electronics, and mechatronics
development are best learned by doing. 

In a way, this class has three tracks:

1. Readings and discussion
1. Skills
1. Projects

### Grading

**10%** Attendance  
**15%** Participation  
**10%** Journal  
**30%** Assignments 
**35%** Final Project    

### Grading Rubric

**Assignments**

- 30% Technical Operation
- 30% Creativity
- 30% Clear Interaction (if applicable)
- 10% Above & beyond

**Midterm and Final projects**
- Functionality: 35%
The robot must function as you have described 
- Construction: 30%
Your robot must be robust and well constructed. 
For example, you must be able to move it
around or bump into it without it falling apart. It must not be delicate.
Any movement must have sufficient power to do so reliably.
- Creative appearance 15%
Appearance should evidence experimentation and creativity, but final result is
not so important, by which I mean I don't really care how it looks as long as
you've experimented
- Intentional behavior: 20%
This is a course in performing robots, 
and so your robot, as an actor, must be able to act in 
an intentional, repeatable manner. By this I mean that 
if the performance calls for a certain sequence of events, 
your robot must be able to perform that sequence reliably.

Student-Led Discussion:

- 100% Engaged the class fully in critical discussion of the reading(s)

Documentation Posts:

- 100% Clear story told with pictures, text, code, video, sketches, etc.


### Course Assignments

This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions; technical
training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics; designing,
fabricating, and programming a performing robot; and putting on a final
performance.

Each week there’s a “walk-through” element that will be covered in class,
which you are expected to do on your own, and an improvisational aspect, where
you take the lesson and make something unique and interesting based on the
in-class review. We will spend time in each class reviewing your work, and
using this as an opportunity to review concepts that are unclear, or
investigate solutions to common problems. Expect to be asked to show your work
every time we meet. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work, other
classes only a few students may, but always be prepared.

All of your work must be documented on your Github repository. Instructions
will be given in class.

### Project documentation:

You are expected to document your work on your Github repository.
The purpose of
this is twofold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate to
me that you are keeping up with the work in the class. I read the site to see
how you are doing. At a minimum, reference to your work is expected, as well
as reference to the readings, and thorough documentation of any research.
Secondly, it is a way to document your work for your own use and that
of others.

You must update your repository weekly with the work you have done for class.

Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don’t put it off until the end.
Photos, video, drawings, schematics, and notes are all valuable forms of
documentation. Explain the project at the beginning of your documentation, so
that people who come to your site from outside this class can understand your
work quickly.

Use pictures, drawings, and videos liberally to explain your work. Don’t
directly upload videos to WordPress. Use Vimeo, Youtube, or another video
hosting site and embed the video in your post.

Always cite the sources of your code, the places you learned techniques from,
and the inspirations of your ideas. Copying code or techniques without
attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers
can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were
were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your
project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or
participant does in response. When it’s interactive, mention and show what the
user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s
never seen the project can understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a
more informed reader (your instructor, or next year’s classmates). Include a
system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and
how they communicate.

The writing is expected to be well reasoned, grammatically correct, and
written as if it were a paper being turned in. You should link to any relevant
sources, and provide as much context as you can using images, video, audio, or
other forms of expression. I’ll set you all up with an account the first day
of class.

#### Student-Led Discussions:

Throughout the semester there will be readings assigned to students
to lead subsequent discussion regarding the readings (or videos).

Instructions to participants:

* If a male and a female both try to speak, let the female go first
* Don’t repeat what someone has already said
* Don’t just say that you liked or disliked the reading. Offer critical insight. Why did you like or dislike it? What does it connect to?
Did it change your mind about something?

Instructions to leader:

You have 15 minutes. Allow 3-5 minutes at the end to wrap up, so
divide the remaining 12-15 minutes into your questions or topics (say
2-5 minutes each) and move on to the next question or topic even if
there are still hands raised Make sure you know what you think the key
points of the reading are, and what is important for everyone to take
away from the reading.  Ask questions that engage the class fully in
critical discussion of the readings. Lead people to the main points of
the reading through questions, but don’t tell people the main points. 

#### Final Project

Details will be provided in class

#### Attendance

Attendance in all classes is mandatory. Be on time and ready to start work at
the posted start time.  Arriving more than ten minutes late to class will
count as an unexcused absence.  Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will
negatively impact your final grade for the class. 

More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in
your attendance grade per absence. After four unexcused absences, you will
fail the class.

If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If
you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.  To receive an excused
absence, you must ask in advance, and receive permission from me.
Excusable absences include family emergencies, job interviews, vastly
different time zones, presenting at a conference, and poor internet
connectivity.

In order to receive credit for an excused absence, you must watch the 
recording and write about it. 
If you miss a discussion, you must write about the subject discussed. 
If you miss a lecture, you must write questions on the subject of the
lecture.

#### Participation

Engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input in the class
is a major part of your grade. Participating in class discussions is helpful
for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress,
but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates with the opportunity
to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.

You are expected to show work in class. This includes working prototypes,
failed assignments, things that don’t work the way you expect, and so forth.
Each week some time is given over to your work, expect to be called on and
show something. Don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did, or failed
to do.

If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material
completely. Asking questions about concepts you do not understand and showing
work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an
opportunity to learn.

#### Laptops:

Laptop use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if
we’re in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates
are presenting or we’re in the midst of a class discussion, please keep your
laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your
attention and active participation, so please respect that and close your lid.

#### Zoom:

Have your camera turned on during class so we can all see each other. This
really helps the cohesion of the class while we are doing remote learning. If
you have a special reason why you need to have your camera turned off please
email me with the details of why and we can discuss.

#### Mobile Phones:

Do not use your phone in class unless it is part of the lesson.
If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
tell me ahead of time.￼

#### Homework exercises
Occasional homework exercises will be used to deepen understanding and
familiarity with technical material such as electronics and programming. All
material will be provided in the required course kit.

#### Projects

Details will be provided in class

#### Supplemental Textbooks

[Here](references.md#books)

#### Communicate

If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, sign up for
office hours, speak with me before class, or after class.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the material or your
progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you have to take the
first step of reaching out to me.

#### Academic Integrity

As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

#### Online Journal

Students must document all their work in their Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.
