Wednesday, September 9th, 7pm (GMT+4) | 11am EDT

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
	- The kit will include a hot glue gun. You will need a safe place with an
		electric outlet to work. To protect your work surface from drops of hot
		glue, cover it with cardboard or paper. You will need to keep the hot glue
		gun out of the reach of children or animals.
	- You will be building a robot. In order to give each robot its unique
		personality, start collecting cardboard boxes for constructing the robot,
		and varied items that can be glued to your robot. Wooden items such as
		coffee stirrers or popsickle sticks, plastic items like bottle caps, and
		cardboard such as toilet paper tubes are excellent candidates. If you have
		younger siblings consider things like pieces of broken toys and game
		tokens. Look for interesting scraps in your recycling bin and when you
		walk outside.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- Using Tinkercad, build a circuit with at least two momentary switches 
	(often called buttons), and at least
  two LEDs. Write a program that does something interesting in a creative 
	way.  Each switch must not simply turn on a corresponding LED.
- Document your work:
	- Create a new folder in your github repository called “September14"
	- Describe your project in README.md and include:
		- A description of your concept and how it was achieved
		- A screenshot of your circuit
			- Your schematic, whether hand drawn or otherwise, must be clear.
			- **Remember what a schematic is and is not.**
			- **Make sure your schematic is big enough to read without enlarging**
		- Problems, if any, and solutions, if any
		- Anything else you can think of
	- Upload your program.
		- Excellent names for variables and functions
		- Well structured
		- Proper indentation
		- Excellent comments
		- Keep the .ino extension so that it is formatted properly.

### Week 2 (September 14 and 16)

- Watch at least the first four of Dan shiffman's [Object Oriented
  Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcbcfkLzgvs&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bb7z2IJaTlzwzIg_5yvL4i)

Production Assignment:

- Write a program that uses the button and the OLED display
	- You will need to combine elements from the button example
		(Example1_PrintButtonStatus) and the OLED example (SSD1306_128x64_i2C).
	- In `setup()`, your program should display the word "Ready"
	- In `loop()`, your program should check to see if the button is pressed
		- If the button is pressed 
			- Count how many times the button is pressed
			- Change the text to say "Pressed"
		- When the button is released
			- Change the text to display how many times the button was pressed


### Week 4 (September 28 and 30)

	and be prepared to discuss

Production Assignment:

Production Assignment:

- Add the OLED display to your motorized contraption, 
- Use it to give your contraption the ability to be expressive.
- Create a 1-2 minute performance that your contraption can perform.
- Use the button to initiate the performance, and have it stop
after performing once. 
	- Optional bonus: Pressing the button again restarts the performance
- Document your work properly with and a link to a video.
	- No schematic is required.

### Week 6 (October 12 and 14)

Theatre: 
Within the limitations of your character, what can you do to make it an
effective actor? Perhaps


#### Assignments Due October 18, 26 and 28

Using your robot as it is, act out a few minutes
from a scene from your choice of a Shakespeare play. 
- Your character should play the role of one of the 
characters in the play 
- You don't need to make any changes, but you can if you want
- You can do the voice of all the others.
- You can use additional items (water bottles, boxes, furniture, etc.) as 
	props or scenery if you wish, but you don't need to build anything
	additional. 
- You can use any sound clips you want or record your own voice
(e.g. using [this](https://audiovoicerecorder.com/) recorder)
- Remember our observations from last week:
	- Brief changing motion seems to be more effective than long
		continuous motion
	- Since the motors are loud, only speak when the motors are off
	- Since the display is hard to see when moving, display big when moving, 
		details when stationary

Due October 18: 

- Create a folder in your github called "robotShakespeare"
- Create a README.md document which will be a short journal of your process
for this assignment. 
	- Start by telling us what play and scene you chose 
	(if you change this later it's OK)
	- Describe any ideas you've had on how you plan to do it
	- Describe any experiments or things you've tried
	- Describe any ideas you've had for scenery or props
	- Add photos or sketches if desired

Due October 26: 

Finish your Shakespeare skit
Document with a video
You may take the video in muliple takes and edit 


Due October 28: Reading Assignment:
