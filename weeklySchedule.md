There is both a reading assignment and a clothing assignment for Monday:

Reading Assignment:

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- Sparkfun [breadboard tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)

[analog output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-output)
- Read about
[analog Input](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-input/)
- If you are new to functions or need to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHAitGzBrg)
tutorials. I will not be teaching this in class and will presume that you know
this.
- If you are new to Object Oriented Programming or need to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's
[OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG2Vbnv0wvg&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=23)
tutorials. I will not be teaching this in class and will presume that you know
this.

Clothing Assignment:

On Monday we will have tool training during class time. 
**Proper clothing is required for this tool training**:
- Closed toed shoes
- No baggy sleeves
- Tied up hair

Also as you will be cutting, drilling, sawing, and sanding, you might want to
wear clothes that you feel comfortable getting a little dusty.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday Sep 13

There are two assignments due:

1. Email Assignment:

Each of you is to write two papers. Your assignment for Wednesday is to tell
me the subjects of your two papers:

- An artist or art collective that is working with robotic art (by some
  definition)
- A researcher or writer or group or book (non-fiction) discussing robot
  ethics. Fiction or movies might also be options but you have to make a
  strong case for the serious discussion taking place

Your assignment for this week is to do a bit of research on your subjects 
to determine that you can find enough material on them to compose a 
paper on each subject
of about 750 words. This is about 3 pages of double spaced, 12 point
text with no images.
Send me an email with you
two subjects before class starts.

If a subject is
selected by more than one student, the first student gets it and all others
much select a different subject

2. Sketching Assignment with your partner:

As discussed in class, you will shortly be building a robot body as an
exercise. For this assignment, I want you to roughly sketch out your robot
body. I encourage you to be creative and experimental, but consider how you
will actually build this from cardboard.
This should not be too detailed as it will probably change as you build.
Do pay attention to these important features:
- The body should be at least 90cm tall (the wheels will add about 10cm
  to meet the minimal height requirement of 1m) 
- The body should provide easy access to the components on the base: Arduino,
  battery, H-Bridge, and an easy way to plug in the battery charger and the
  USB cable. Leaving the back open is acceptable but it must be strong enough
  to support the rest of the body

Take a picture of your sketch and upload it to your Github repository in the
README.md file. Add the date. This will be your journal of progress in this
class.

#### Assignments Due Monday Sep 18

Fabrication assignment:

- Finish your robot base, except for the two casters. The casters should
  arrive on Monday.
- Write an Arduino program to make both motors work in some fashion. Verify
  that the motors both turn.
- Update your journal 
    - Include some pictures of your robot base 
    - Describe any issues you had and how you overcame them

Reading assignment:

- Read [Chapter 7: Machines/Mechanicals](doc/entangledBook_Machines_Mechanicals.pdf) 
from the book *Entangled: Technology
and the Transformation of Performance* by Chris Salter
- Update your journal by noting the thing from the reading that interested you
  the most, and why

#### Assignments Due Wednesday Sep 20

Fabrication assignment:

- Finish robot base 
- Write an Arduino program to make your robot dance **but pay attention to the
  warning in the lecture notes**

Reading assignment:

- Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZKxUFkwCc8)
short video introducing the concept of hobby RC radio transmitters and
receivers and how we will use them with Arduino
- Read this more detailed tutorial on how to use
[RC Hobby Controllers and Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/348)

#### Assignments Due Monday Sep 25

Reading assignment:

- Read about the [Adafruit Music Maker Shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-music-maker-shield-vs1053-mp3-wav-wave-ogg-vorbis-player?view=all)
- [Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in
    Love](doc/New_Media_Dramaturgy_Performance_Media_and_New-Materialism_5_Robots_Asleep_Awake_Alone_and_in_Love.pdf).

Writing assignment:

Write a short story (30 seconds - 1 minute) for your robot which can be
depicted only using motion.  Program your robot to tell this story. Document
your story in your journal and include a video of your robot performing this
story.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday Sep 27
Reply on Discord, one person from each new team with the following information:
1. Were you able to pair your hobby RC transmitter and receiver?
1. Were you able to upload the code to see the values for the four radio channels?
1. Could you reliably control the values being displayed for all four radio channels by manipulating the appropriate 4 input on the transmitter?

#### Assignments Due Monday October 02
Working with your new partner (list is in the lecture notes), get your robot
working with the hobby RC remote control. 
1. First verify that you can reliably control the numbers being displayed for
   all four radio channels. You only need two, but let's make sure all 4 work.
1. Reconnect your L298 H-bridge to the Arduino. 
1. Decide which pins are available for controlling the H-bridge. You need 4
   pins. You can't use the pins that are in use by the radio, and as always,
   don't use pins 0 or 1.
1. Use the values from the radio to control your robot. e.g. 

```
// use whichever channel is the trigger to control forward and reverse movement
if (rc_values[RC_CH3] > 17) reverse();
if (rc_values[RC_CH3] < 13) forward();
if ((rc_values[RC_CH3] < 17) && (rc_values[RC_CH3] < 13)) stop();

// use whichever channel is the steering wheel to turn:
if (rc_values[RC_CH2] > 18) turnRight();
```

Save your well organized and well commented code in Github,
and document your process in your journal

##### todays-assignment
#### Assignments Due Wednesday October 04

- Finish soldering the wires between the Hobby RC shield and the H-bridge. You
  may need to send the edges of the connector to fit into the H-bridge as the
  space is pretty tight. Let me know if you need me to show you how to do
  that.
- I found a bunch of 16GB micro SD cards. Bring me your big ones and I'll
  exchange for 16GB.
- Test the Music Maker Shield and get it to play audio. 


#### Assignments Due October 28

Writing assignment:

One of your papers is due. You will give a short (~5 minutes) presentation to
the class summarizing your research. Think of it as a trailer: an enticement
to read your paper.

#### Assignments Due November 15

Writing assignment:

Your second papers is due. You will give a short (~5 minutes) presentation to
the class summarizing your research. Think of it as a trailer: an enticement
to read your paper.
