There is both a reading assignment and a clothing assignment for Monday:

Reading Assignment:

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- Sparkfun [breadboard tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//digital-input-output/)
- Read about 
[analog output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-output)
- Read about
[analog Input](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-input/)
- If you are new to functions or need to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHAitGzBrg)
tutorials. I will not be teaching this in class and will presume that you know
this.
- If you are new to Object Oriented Programming or need to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's
[OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG2Vbnv0wvg&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=23)
tutorials. I will not be teaching this in class and will presume that you know
this.

Clothing Assignment:

On Monday we will have tool training during class time. Proper clothing
is required for this tool training:
- Closed toed shoes
- No baggy sleeves
- tied up hair

Also as you will be cutting, drilling, sawing, and sanding, you might want to
wear clothes that you feel comfortable getting a little dusty.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday Sep 13

There are two assignments due:

1. Email Assignment:

Each of you is to write two papers. Your assignment for Wednesday is to tell
me the subjects of your two papers:

- An artist or art collective that is working with robotic art (by some
  definition)
- A researcher or writer or group or book (non-fiction) discussing robot
  ethics. Fiction or movies might also be options but you have to make a
  strong case for the serious discussion taking place

Your selection is due in my mailbox before class starts

If a subject is
selected by more than one student, the first student gets it and all others
much select a different subject

2. Sketching Assignment with your partner:

As discussed in class, you will shortly be building a robot body as an
exercise. For this assignment, I want you to roughly sketch out your robot
body. This should not be too detailed as a lot will change as you start
building. Do pay attention to these important features:
- The body should be at least 90cm tall (the wheels will add about 10cm
  to meet the minimal height requirement of 1m) 
- The body should provide easy access to the components on the base: Arduino,
  battery, H-Bridge, and an easy way to plug in the battery charger and the
  USB cable

Take a picture of your sketch and upload it to your Github repository in the
README.md file. Add the date. This will be your journal of progress in this
class.
