watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.

#### Assignments Due Sep 12

Reading Assignment:

Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called September12 in your
Github repository.
- [Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in
	Love](doc/New_Media_Dramaturgy_Performance_Media_and_New-Materialism_5_Robots_Asleep_Awake_Alone_and_in_Love.pdf).

- You should have received email with a coupon granting you access to 
	*Getting Started with Arduino, 3rd Edition*. 
	Redeem that coupon and read Chapter 8, Automatic Garden-Irrigation System. 
	You don't need to understand everything
	in that chapter, what I want you to get out of it is how to work with an
	Arduino Prototyping Shield.

#### Assignments Due Sep 19

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:

- Read the first resource 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#arduino-multitasking-resources) 
and look at the other two to solidify
your understanding of avoiding the use of `delay()` 
- Read
  [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) or
  any other tutorial on using a multimeter
- If you need a review of the servo motor, read
  [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/Sweep)
  or any other servo motor tutorial
- Read about Neopixels
	[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all).
	This is a very long article with lots of information; I don't expect you to
	read it all in detail. Glance over the different products available, as we
	have some of these and can order others. Pay attention to the section titled
	"Basic Connections" because that's what you'll need to do. Note the use of
	an external power supply, similar to what we've done with the motor driver. 
	Pay particular attention to the warnings in the red and orange boxes. Pay
	attention also to the section "Best Practices".

  - Use the special tool to attache
		- The motor to the black bracket
		- The hub to the motor shaft
		- Contact me if you need the tool as it is in my office
- Use the hot glue gun (carefully!) to attach scrap wood to the platform
	so that it doesn't tip over
	- If you need more scrap wood let me know
- Power Arduino from battery pack
  - Ask other students how to attach the coax connector if you don't know how
- Using a small amount of hot glue, attach the Arduino, motor driver, and
	battery pack to the wooden platform. 
- Test your robot base! You should be able to program it to move forwards,
	backwards, and to turn
- Code it to exhibit some personality or emotion only using movement
  but don't share it outside of your team

#### Assignments Due Wednesday September 28

Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called September28 in your
Github repository.

- The first paragraph (page 121) and 
*Mechanical Actors* 
(pages 140-151) of chapter 6
from the book [Digital Theatre](doc/Masura2020_Book_DigitalTheatre.pdf)
by Nadja Masura 
	- Shamsa and Louis will lead

#### Assignments Due Monday October 3

Make a large body (less than your height) for your robot out of cardboard. 
It does not need to be anthropomorphic. In fact, I encourage you to be
creative.
- Document your process with a few photographs
- Experiment with moving your robot around. You may program the movements
	directly, like you did for the last assignment, 
	or you may control it using the hobby RC system I introduced this week.
	- You may need to change the speed
		- With the added weight, it may not move at slow speeds
		- With the added height, it may fall over if you start or stop
			too suddenly
		- Experiment and find what works
- Document your robot moving with a short video
- Post your photographs, video, and code on your Github repository
	in a new folder named "October3"

Be prepared to work in the carpentry shop by dressing appropriately:
- Long pants
- Closed-toed shoes 
- pulled back hair
- Wear clothes that might get dusty
- Be prepared to stay in the carpentry shop for about an hour, so if you need
	water or to use the bathroom do that before class starts
- Please be on time. We will all go to the carpentry shop together.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday October 5

Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called October05 in your
Github repository.

- [Introduction](doc/TheFreudianRobot_DigitalMediaandtheFutureoftheUnconscious_LydiaHLiu/introduction.pdf)
  from *The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious*
  by Lydia H. Liu (the rest of the book is in the same folder if you are
  curious to read the rest - it is fascinating)
	- Dania and Joseph will lead


#### Assignments Due Monday October 10

Working in groups, come up with an outline for a play. You may use any
of the ideas that came up in class. You may want to watch *Shrek* and *Inside
Out* which I imagine we have in our library. You don't need to create all the
dialogue, but the outline must be detailed enough to show how it could be
expanded to 15 minutes. Your play should have 7 characters played by robots.
The robots do not need to be humanoid at all.

Groups:

- Louis, Alpha, Fatima, Dania
- Yoki, Omar, Dhabia
- Yupu, Shamsa, Eadin, Joseph
- Mudi, Hessa, Oliver

The first member of each of your teams (Louis, Yoki, Yupu, Mudi) should
put the outline in a file called README.md in a new folder called October10
in your Github repository

#### Assignments Due Wednesday October 12

Production assignment

- Make your robot remote controlled using the hobby RC radios
	- Some of you already have done this so learn from each other.
- Practice driving, especially when it's far away and moving in different
	directions. It takes practice to know which way to steer when e.g. it's
	coming towards you. Make sure that both of you practice this.
- Practice delivering a short (1-2 minute) speech with your robot. You can
	read the speech and have the robot move in different ways to accompany what
	you are trying to say. The speech can be anything: something famous,
	something you found, something you wrote. What matters here is using
	movement to emphasize or accompany words. 
- Take a short video of the two practices and upload to Github in a new folder
	*October12*. Create a short README.md with any observations, challenges, or
	ideas you had while doing this.

Reading assignment

Read carefully and be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions to the reading. Put this in the same README.md.

- [Thinking Something Makes it So](doc/LePage2016_Chapter_ThinkingSomethingMakesItSoPerf.pdf)
	- Dhabia and Oliver will lead

#### Assignments Due Monday October 31

Reading assignments

1. Watch [Inside
	 Out](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1bthiq5/nyu_aleph004218186)

2. Read carefully [Eight Lessons Learned about Non-verbal Interactions through
	 Robot Theater](doc/socialRobotics.pdf) (page 42-51) and be prepared to
	 discuss. Prepare questions, observations, and reactions to the reading. Put
	 this in a README.md, in the folder dated october31.
	- Yupu and Mudi will lead

Production assignments **Start now this is big**

As a group, write a 2 page first draft of a play based on the ideas from 
the movie Inside Out. The play does not need to tell any part of the story of
the movie. The characters of your play are 1) a robot playing the role of the
human and 2) 5 or 6 robots playing the roles of the different emotions which
try to control the "human" robot, perhaps to achieve some goal (or not; it's
your choice).

The play should include rough stage direction (where the different robots
start, where they move to, what other motions or activations they have (facial
expressions, other movements (e.g. with servo motors), etc.

Include a brief description of each character in the play.

Recall (or review) [Tegan's
lecture](https://www.nfi.edu/writing-a-play-script/) about dramaturgy. There
are also endless resources online such as
[this](https://www.nfi.edu/writing-a-play-script/) which I found just by
Googling "play outline".

The whole class is to work on this together. You may collaborate in any way
you wish: meeting in person or not, using any shared writing method you wish,
working in groups or all together.

Rehearse the play at least twice by reading the different parts by different
people

#### Assignments Due Wednesday November 2

Production assignments

- Attach a servo motor to your nRF receiver board, and a potentiometer to your
	nRF transmitter board. Modify the code to send values from the potentiometer
	to control the servo motor
	- If you don't know how to use a potentiometer, Google "Arduino
		potentiometer"
	- If you don't know how to use a servo motor, Google "Arduino
		servo motor"
	- If you don't know how to send more information, look at the other examples
		in the nRF folder in the resources
		[repository](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses) 
- Read about the [Adafruit Music Maker Shield](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-music-maker-shield-vs1053-mp3-wav-wave-ogg-vorbis-player?view=all)

### todays-assignment
#### Assignments Due Monday November 7 

Production Assignment

Connect Music Maker Shield to an Arduino and make it play a sound. You will
  need a micro SD card. If you don't have one, you may check one out of the IM
  lab or the Film department. Reserve a card using the IM checkout system.

Discussion Assignment

Currently your script calls for 7 robots:
- Anger
- Fear
- Sadness
- Disgust
- Joy
- Imaginary Friend
- Human Student

It's time now to identify the teams that will build each robot. We have 14
students, so 7 teams of two people each for most robots. As we discussed in
class, the Imaginary Friend robot doesn't need to do much, and neither does
the Human Student, so these robots can be done by one student instead of two.
That accounts for 12 students, leaving 2 students without a robot to build.
How should this be resolved?

Working as a group, make decisions about the following:

- Do you want to find a student to volunteer to be the Human Student?  They
	will have to be present at some of the rehearsals so that they know what
	they need to do. This means that we need to find a job for the student who
	would be building the Human Student
- Should you create a role for an additional Emotion robot for the 2 students
	without a robot?
- Contrary to what I said earlier, I'm going to allow you to chose who you'd
	like to work with. Discuss the various robots and decide who is going to be
	responsible for which robot.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday November 9 (tentative) 

Reading assignment
- [Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures](doc/eckersall2015.pdf)
	- Fatima and Alpha will lead the discussion
- Working with your nRF partner, add the Music Maker Shield to your nRF setup,
  and add the ability to control which track is playing from the transmitter
- Review Chapter 8, Automatic Garden-Irrigation System. See the assignment for
	September 12 above for instructions on how to access the book.
