Email Assignment:

- Join Discord. Email me if you are missing the invitation.
- Create your github account and repository. Email me a link to your github repository.
- Choose a topic, 
	related to Performing Robots, 
	possibly inspired by [this](references.md) list, on which
	you will give a 10 minute presentation later in the semester.

  Your topic can be an article, a robot, a performance, a book, an artist,
	an event, etc. 

	Your topic can not be a movie or book of fiction. (e.g. not Wall-E or
	Terminator)

  Email your topic to me, which I will
  put on our website. You must pick a topic that no one else has chosen.

Writing Assignment:

- Read [this](doc/autonomousRobotsAsPerformingAgents.pdf) paper
	- In your Github repository, create a folder named 'september6'
	- In that folder, create a file named 'README.md'
	- In that file, write a response to the paper (about half a page, more if
		you wish)
- 
Reading Assignment:
Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- Sparkfun [breadboard
	tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//digital-input-output/)
- Read about 
[analog output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-output)
- Read about
[analog Input](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-input/)
- If you are new to functions or want to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.

#### Assignments Due September 8

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
	- The kit will include a hot glue gun and a soldering iron. 
		You will need a safe place with an
		electric outlet to work. To protect your work surface from drops of hot
		glue, cover it with cardboard or paper. You will need to keep the hot glue
		gun out of the reach of children or animals.
	- You will be building a robot. In order to give each robot its unique
		personality, start collecting cardboard boxes for constructing the robot,
		and varied items that can be glued to your robot. Wooden items such as
		coffee stirrers or popsickle sticks, plastic items like bottle caps, and
		cardboard such as toilet paper tubes are excellent candidates. If you have
		younger siblings consider things like pieces of broken toys and game
		tokens. Look for interesting scraps in your recycling bin and when you
		walk outside.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- Build a circuit with at least two momentary switches 
	(often called buttons), and at least
  two LEDs. Write a program that does something interesting in a creative 
	way.  Each switch must not simply turn on a corresponding LED.
- Document your work:
	- Create a new folder in your github repository called â€œSeptember8"
	- Describe your project in README.md and include:
		- A description of your concept and how it was achieved
		- A screenshot of your circuit
			- Your schematic, whether hand drawn or otherwise, must be clear.
			- **Remember what a schematic is and is not.**
			- **Make sure your schematic is big enough to read without enlarging**
		- Problems, if any, and solutions, if any
		- Anything else you can think of
	- Upload your program.
		- Excellent names for variables and functions
		- Well structured
		- Proper indentation
		- Excellent comments
		- Keep the .ino extension so that it is formatted properly.
