#### Assignments Due Sep 5

Email Assignment:

- Join Discord. Email me if you are missing the invitation.
- Create your github account and repository. Email me a link to your github repository.
- Choose a topic, 
	related to Performing Robots, 
	possibly (but not necessarily) from [this](references.md) list, on which
	you will give a 10 minute presentation later in the semester.
  - Your topic can be an article, a robot, a performance, a book, an artist,
	an event, etc. 
	- Your topic can *not* be a movie or book of fiction. (e.g. not Wall-E or
	Terminator)
  - Email your topic to me, which I will
  put on our website. You must pick a topic that no one else has chosen.
- There is a lot to read for next week, so you might want to start now

Production Assignment:
- TBA

Writing Assignment:

- Read [this](doc/autonomousRobotsAsPerformingAgents.pdf) paper
	- In your Github repository, create a folder named 'september5'
	- In that folder, create a file named 'README.md'
	- In that file, write a response to the paper (about half a page, more if
		you wish)
 
Reading Assignment:

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- Sparkfun [breadboard tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons//digital-input-output/)
- Read about 
[analog output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-output)
- Read about
[analog Input](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-input/)
- If you are new to functions or want to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.

#### Assignments Due Sep 12

Reading Assignment:

Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called September12 in your
Github repository.
- [Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in
	Love](doc/New_Media_Dramaturgy_Performance_Media_and_New-Materialism_5_Robots_Asleep_Awake_Alone_and_in_Love.pdf).
- Yoki and Omar will lead us in discussion.

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- If you are new to soldering, read one or both of
	[these](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#soldering)
- Read
	[this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) or
	any other tutorial on using a multimeter
- You should have received email with a coupon granting you access to 
	*Getting Started with Arduino, 3rd Edition*. 
	Redeem that coupon and read Chapter 8, Automatic Garden-Irrigation System. 
	You don't need to understand everything
	in that chapter, what I want you to get out of it is how to work with an
	Arduino Prototyping Shield.

#### Assignments Due Sep 19

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:

- Read the first resource 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#arduino-multitasking-resources) 
and look at the other two to solidify
your understanding of avoiding the use of `delay()` 
- Read
  [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) or
  any other tutorial on using a multimeter
- If you need a review of the servo motor, read
  [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/Sweep)
  or any other servo motor tutorial
- Read about Neopixels
	[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all).
	This is a very long article with lots of information; I don't expect you to
	read it all in detail. Glance over the different products available, as we
	have some of these and can order others. Pay attention to the section titled
	"Basic Connections" because that's what you'll need to do. Note the use of
	an external power supply, similar to what we've done with the motor driver. 
	Pay particular attention to the warnings in the red and orange boxes. Pay
	attention also to the section "Best Practices".

Production Assignment:

Finish the work we started in class today. This includes:
- Attach motors and wheels
  - Use the special screws that I showed you
		- Contact me if you need the screws as they are in my office
  - Use the special tool to attache
		- The motor to the black bracket
		- The hub to the motor shaft
		- Contact me if you need the tool as it is in my office
- Use the hot glue gun (carefully!) to attach scrap wood to the platform
	so that it doesn't tip over
	- If you need more scrap wood let me know
- Power Arduino from battery pack
  - Ask other students how to attach the coax connector if you don't know how
- Using a small amount of hot glue, attach the Arduino, motor driver, and
	battery pack to the wooden platform. 
- Test your robot base! You should be able to program it to move forwards,
	backwards, and to turn
- Code it to exhibit some personality or emotion only using movement
  but don't share it outside of your team
- Next week, we will try to guess the personality from the motion
