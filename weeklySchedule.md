Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called September12 in your
Github repository.
- [Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in
	Love](doc/New_Media_Dramaturgy_Performance_Media_and_New-Materialism_5_Robots_Asleep_Awake_Alone_and_in_Love.pdf).

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:
- If you are new to soldering, read one or both of
	[these](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#soldering)
- Read
	[this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) or
	any other tutorial on using a multimeter
- You should have received email with a coupon granting you access to 
	*Getting Started with Arduino, 3rd Edition*. 
	Redeem that coupon and read Chapter 8, Automatic Garden-Irrigation System. 
	You don't need to understand everything
	in that chapter, what I want you to get out of it is how to work with an
	Arduino Prototyping Shield.

#### Assignments Due Sep 19

Read, review, or skim as you feel is necessary:

- Read the first resource 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#arduino-multitasking-resources) 
and look at the other two to solidify
your understanding of avoiding the use of `delay()` 
- Read
  [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) or
  any other tutorial on using a multimeter
- If you need a review of the servo motor, read
  [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/Sweep)
  or any other servo motor tutorial
- Read about Neopixels
	[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all).
	This is a very long article with lots of information; I don't expect you to
	read it all in detail. Glance over the different products available, as we
	have some of these and can order others. Pay attention to the section titled
	"Basic Connections" because that's what you'll need to do. Note the use of
	an external power supply, similar to what we've done with the motor driver. 
	Pay particular attention to the warnings in the red and orange boxes. Pay
	attention also to the section "Best Practices".

		- Contact me if you need the screws as they are in my office
  - Use the special tool to attache
		- The motor to the black bracket
		- The hub to the motor shaft
		- Contact me if you need the tool as it is in my office
- Use the hot glue gun (carefully!) to attach scrap wood to the platform
	so that it doesn't tip over
	- If you need more scrap wood let me know
- Power Arduino from battery pack
  - Ask other students how to attach the coax connector if you don't know how
- Using a small amount of hot glue, attach the Arduino, motor driver, and
	battery pack to the wooden platform. 
- Test your robot base! You should be able to program it to move forwards,
	backwards, and to turn
- Code it to exhibit some personality or emotion only using movement
  but don't share it outside of your team
- Next week, we will try to guess the personality from the motion

#### Assignments Due Wednesday September 28

	- Shamsa and Louis will lead

#### Assignments Due Monday October 3

Make a large body (less than your height) for your robot out of cardboard. 
It does not need to be anthropomorphic. In fact, I encourage you to be
creative.
- Document your process with a few photographs
- Experiment with moving your robot around. You may program the movements
	directly, like you did for the last assignment, 
	or you may control it using the hobby RC system I introduced this week.
	- You may need to change the speed
		- With the added weight, it may not move at slow speeds
		- With the added height, it may fall over if you start or stop
			too suddenly
		- Experiment and find what works
- Document your robot moving with a short video
- Post your photographs, video, and code on your Github repository
	in a new folder named "October3"

Be prepared to work in the carpentry shop by dressing appropriately:
- Long pants
- Closed-toed shoes 
- pulled back hair
- Wear clothes that might get dusty
- Be prepared to stay in the carpentry shop for about an hour, so if you need
	water or to use the bathroom do that before class starts
- Please be on time. We will all go to the carpentry shop together.

#### Assignments Due Wednesday October 5

Read carefully and Be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions in a short README.md in a new folder called October05 in your
Github repository.

- [Introduction](doc/TheFreudianRobot_DigitalMediaandtheFutureoftheUnconscious_LydiaHLiu/introduction.pdf)
  from *The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious*
  by Lydia H. Liu (the rest of the book is in the same folder if you are
  curious to read the rest - it is fascinating)
	- Dania and Joseph will lead


### todays-assignment
#### Assignments Due Monday October 10

Working in groups, come up with an outline for a play. You may use any
of the ideas that came up in class. You may want to watch *Shrek* and *Inside
Out* which I imagine we have in our library. You don't need to create all the
dialogue, but the outline must be detailed enough to show how it could be
expanded to 15 minutes. Your play should have 7 characters played by robots.
The robots do not need to be humanoid at all.

Groups:

- Alpha, Fatima, Louis, Dania
- Yoki, Omar, Dhabia
- Shamsa, Yupu, Eadin, Joseph
- Hessa, Mudhi, Oliver

#### Assignments Due Wednesday October 12

Production assignment

- Make your robot remote controlled using the hobby RC radios
	- Some of you already have done this so learn from each other.
- Practice driving, especially when it's far away and moving in different
	directions. It takes practice to know which way to steer when e.g. it's
	coming towards you. Make sure that both of you practice this.
- Practice delivering a short (1-2 minute) speech with your robot. You can
	read the speech and have the robot move in different ways to accompany what
	you are trying to say. The speech can be anything: something famous,
	something you found, something you wrote. What matters here is using
	movement to emphasize or accompany words. 
- Take a short video of the two practices and upload to Github in a new folder
	*October10*. Create a short README.md with any observations, challenges, or
	ideas you had while doing this.

Reading assignment

Read carefully and be prepared to discuss. Prepare questions, observations,
and reactions to the reading. Put this in the same README.md.

- [Thinking Something Makes it So](doc/LePage2016_Chapter_ThinkingSomethingMakesItSoPerf.pdf)
	- Dhabia and Oliver will lead

### Future Readings

- [Eight Lessons Learned about Non-verbal Interactions through Robot Theater](socialRobotics.pdf)
	- Yupu and Mudhi will lead

- [Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures](eckersall2015.pdf)
	- Fatima and Alpha will lead the discussion
